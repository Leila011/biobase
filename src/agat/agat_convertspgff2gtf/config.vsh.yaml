    The script aims to convert any GTF/GFF file into a proper GTF file. Full
    information about the format can be found here:
    https://agat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gxf.html You can choose among 7
    different GTF types (1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3 or relax). Depending the
    version selected the script will filter out the features that are not
    accepted. For GTF2.5 and 3, every level1 feature (e.g nc_gene
    pseudogene) will be converted into gene feature and every level2 feature
    (e.g mRNA ncRNA) will be converted into transcript feature. Using the
    "relax" option you will produce a GTF-like output keeping all original
    feature types (3rd column). No modification will occur e.g. mRNA to
    transcript.

    To be fully GTF compliant all feature have a gene_id and a transcript_id
    attribute. The gene_id is unique identifier for the genomic source of
    the transcript, which is used to group transcripts into genes. The
    transcript_id is a unique identifier for the predicted transcript, which
    is used to group features into transcripts.

          Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml file from the working directory if any, otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose". The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file (located elsewhere or named differently).
